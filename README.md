# House-Rent-Predicition
Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to leverage machine learning techniques to build a predictive model that can estimate rental prices for houses or apartments. The model will take input features related to the property and output an estimated rental cost.

Steps:

Data Collection:

Gather a comprehensive dataset containing information on rental properties, including features such as the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage, location, amenities, etc.
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:

Handle missing data, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the dataset.
Encode categorical variables and preprocess numerical features.
Explore relationships between different features.
Feature Engineering:

Extract relevant features from the dataset.
Create new features that might enhance the predictive power of the model.
Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.
Model Selection:

Choose appropriate regression models for predicting rental prices, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Gradient Boosting.
Model Training:

Train the selected model using the training dataset.
Fine-tune hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using the testing dataset.
Utilize metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared to assess the model's accuracy.
Deployment (Optional):

If applicable, deploy the trained model as a web application or API that users can interact with to get rental price predictions.
